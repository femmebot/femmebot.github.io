### Shipping Products is Better than Getting Tasks Done


25x52 is an experiment. It&rsquo;s a personal initiative to ship 25 projects in 52 weeks.

Why 52 weeks? I wanted to set a timeline that was long enough to compel a behavior change. In order to change from **Doing** to **Shipping**, I needed to establish a long-term habit of launching projects.

Why 25 projects? It roughly corresponds to launching a project every two weeks which, at the time, seemed perfectly reasonable and sustainable over a 1-year period. Two weeks also would provide enough time to tackle projects that had more substance than typical weekend hacks.

What&rsquo;s a project? Anything that&rsquo;s useful to someone else. Generally, I&rsquo;m interested in developing projects that help others, encourage learning and foster community among creative and product-minded folks.
