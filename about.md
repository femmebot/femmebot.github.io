### Gettings products shipped > Getting things done


25x52 is an experiment. It&rsquo;s a personal initiative to ship 25 projects in 52 weeks. 

Why 52 weeks? I wanted to set a timeline that was long enough to compel a behavior change. In order to change from **Doing** to **Shipping**, I needed to establish a long-term habit of launching projects. 

Why 25 projects? It roughly corresponds to launching a project every two weeks which, at the time, seemed perfectly reasonable and sustainable over a 1-year period. Two weeks also would provide enough time to tackle projects that had more substance than typical weekend hacks.

What&rsquo;s a project? Anything that&rsquo;s useful to someone else. Generally, I&rsquo;m interested in developing projects that help others, encourage learning and foster community among creative and product-minded folks.

<!-- For a while, I took satisfaction in being very busy&mdash;starting the work day with breakfast meetings and wrapping up work 12-16 hours later. My calendar was crammed with meetings&mdash;usually booked 3 weeks in advance&mdash;mostly to help others build products. Yet, despite all that activity, I had little tangible proof of the work I&rsquo;ve done. -->
